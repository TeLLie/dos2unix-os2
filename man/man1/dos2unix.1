.SH NAME
dos2unix \- DOS/Mac to Unix and vice versa text file format converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&    dos2unix [options] [FILE ...] [\-n INFILE OUTFILE ...]
\&    unix2dos [options] [FILE ...] [\-n INFILE OUTFILE ...]
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The dos2unix package includes utilities \f(CW\*(C`dos2unix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`unix2dos\*(C'\fR to convert
plain text files in DOS or Mac format to Unix format and vice versa.
.PP
In DOS/Windows text files a line break, also known as newline, is a combination
of two characters: a Carriage Return (CR) followed by a Line Feed (LF). In Unix
text files a line break is a single character: the Line Feed (LF). In Mac text
files, prior to Mac OS X, a line break was single Carriage Return (CR)
character. Nowadays Mac OS uses Unix style (LF) line breaks.
.PP
Besides line breaks dos2unix can also convert the encoding of files. A few
DOS code pages can be converted to Unix Latin\-1. And Windows Unicode (UTF\-16)
files can be converted to Unix Unicode (UTF\-8) files.
.PP
Binary files are automatically skipped, unless conversion is forced.
.PP
Non-regular files, such as directories and FIFOs, are automatically skipped.
.PP
Symbolic links and their targets are by default kept untouched.  Symbolic links
can optionally be replaced, or the output can be written to the symbolic link
target.  Writing to a symbolic link target is not supported on Windows.
.PP
dos2unix was modelled after dos2unix under SunOS/Solaris.  There is one
important difference with the original SunOS/Solaris version. This version does
by default in-place conversion (old file mode), while the original
SunOS/Solaris version only supports paired conversion (new file mode). See also
options \f(CW\*(C`\-o\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-n\*(C'\fR. Another difference is that the SunOS/Solaris version
uses by default \fIiso\fR mode conversion while this version uses by default \fIascii\fR
mode conversion.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP \fB\-\-\fR 4
.IX Item "--"
Treat all following options as file names. Use this option if you want to
convert files whose names start with a dash. For instance to convert
a file named "\-foo", you can use this command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dos2unix \-\- \-foo
.Ve
.Sp
Or in new file mode:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dos2unix \-n \-\- \-foo out.txt
.Ve
.IP \fB\-\-allow\-chown\fR 4
.IX Item "--allow-chown"
Allow file ownership change in old file mode.
.Sp
When this option is used, the conversion will not be aborted when the user
and/or group ownership of the original file can't be preserved in old file
mode. Conversion will continue and the converted file will get the same new
ownership as if it was converted in new file mode. See also options \f(CW\*(C`\-o\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-n\*(C'\fR. This option is only available if dos2unix has support for preserving
the user and group ownership of files.
.IP \fB\-ascii\fR 4
.IX Item "-ascii"
Default conversion mode. See also section CONVERSION MODES.
.IP \fB\-iso\fR 4
.IX Item "-iso"
Conversion between DOS and ISO\-8859\-1 character set. See also section
CONVERSION MODES.
.IP \fB\-1252\fR 4
.IX Item "-1252"
Use Windows code page 1252 (Western European).
.IP \fB\-437\fR 4
.IX Item "-437"
Use DOS code page 437 (US). This is the default code page used for ISO conversion.
.IP \fB\-850\fR 4
.IX Item "-850"
Use DOS code page 850 (Western European).
.IP \fB\-860\fR 4
.IX Item "-860"
Use DOS code page 860 (Portuguese).
.IP \fB\-863\fR 4
.IX Item "-863"
Use DOS code page 863 (French Canadian).
.IP \fB\-865\fR 4
.IX Item "-865"
Use DOS code page 865 (Nordic).
.IP \fB\-7\fR 4
.IX Item "-7"
Convert 8 bit characters to 7 bit space.
.IP "\fB\-b, \-\-keep\-bom\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b, --keep-bom"
Keep Byte Order Mark (BOM). When the input file has a BOM, write a BOM in
the output file. This is the default behavior when converting to DOS line
breaks. See also option \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-c, \-\-convmode CONVMODE\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --convmode CONVMODE"
Set conversion mode. Where CONVMODE is one of:
\&\fIascii\fR, \fI7bit\fR, \fIiso\fR, \fImac\fR
with ascii being the default.
.IP "\fB\-D, \-\-display\-enc ENCODING\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D, --display-enc ENCODING"
Set encoding of displayed text. Where ENCODING is one of:
\&\fIansi\fR, \fIunicode\fR, \fIunicodebom\fR, \fIutf8\fR, \fIutf8bom\fR
with ansi being the default.
.Sp
This option is only available in dos2unix for Windows with Unicode
file name support. This option has no effect on the actual file names
read and written, only on how they are displayed.
.Sp
There are several methods for displaying text in a Windows console based on the
encoding of the text. They all have their own advantages and disadvantages.
.RS 4
.IP \fBansi\fR 4
.IX Item "ansi"
dos2unix's default method is to use ANSI encoded text. The advantage is that it
is backwards compatible. It works with raster and TrueType fonts. In some
regions you may need to change the active DOS OEM code page to the Windows
system ANSI code page using the \f(CW\*(C`chcp\*(C'\fR command, because dos2unix uses the
Windows system code page.
.Sp
The disadvantage of ansi is that international file names with characters not
inside the system default code page are not displayed properly. You will
see a question mark, or a wrong symbol instead. When you don't work with
foreign file names this method is OK.
.IP "\fBunicode, unicodebom\fR" 4
.IX Item "unicode, unicodebom"
The advantage of unicode (the Windows name for UTF\-16) encoding is that text is
usually properly displayed. There is no need to change the active code page.
You may need to set the console's font to a TrueType font to have international
characters displayed properly. When a character is not included in the TrueType
font you usually see a small square, sometimes with a question mark in it.
.Sp
When you use the ConEmu console all text is displayed properly, because ConEmu
automatically selects a good font.
.Sp
The disadvantage of unicode is that it is not compatible with ASCII. The output
is not easy to handle when you redirect it to another program.
.Sp
When method \f(CW\*(C`unicodebom\*(C'\fR is used the Unicode text will be preceded with a BOM
(Byte Order Mark). A BOM is required for correct redirection or piping in
PowerShell.
.IP "\fButf8, utf8bom\fR" 4
.IX Item "utf8, utf8bom"
The advantage of utf8 is that it is compatible with ASCII. You need to set the
console's font to a TrueType font. With a TrueType font the text is displayed
similar as with the \f(CW\*(C`unicode\*(C'\fR encoding.
.Sp
The disadvantage is that when you use the default raster font all non-ASCII
characters are displayed wrong. Not only unicode file names, but also
translated messages become unreadable. On Windows configured for an East-Asian
region you may see a lot of flickering of the console when the messages are
displayed.
.Sp
In a ConEmu console the utf8 encoding method works well.
.Sp
When method \f(CW\*(C`utf8bom\*(C'\fR is used the UTF\-8 text will be preceded with a BOM
(Byte Order Mark). A BOM is required for correct redirection or piping in
PowerShell.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The default encoding can be changed with environment variable DOS2UNIX_DISPLAY_ENC
by setting it to \f(CW\*(C`unicode\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`unicodebom\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`utf8bom\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-e, \-\-add\-eol\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e, --add-eol"
Add a line break to the last line if there isn't one. This works for every
conversion.
.Sp
A file converted from DOS to Unix format may lack a line break on the last
line. There are text editors that write text files without a line break on the
last line. Some Unix programs have problems processing these files, because the
POSIX standard defines that every line in a text file must end with a
terminating newline character. For instance concatenating files may not give
the expected result.
.IP "\fB\-f, \-\-force\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --force"
Force conversion of binary files.
.IP "\fB\-gb, \-\-gb18030\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gb, --gb18030"
On Windows UTF\-16 files are by default converted to UTF\-8, regardless of the
locale setting. Use this option to convert UTF\-16 files to GB18030. This option
is only available on Windows. See also section GB18030.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Display help and exit.
.IP "\fB\-i[FLAGS], \-\-info[=FLAGS] FILE ...\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i[FLAGS], --info[=FLAGS] FILE ..."
Display file information. No conversion is done.
.Sp
The following information is printed, in this order: number of DOS line breaks,
number of Unix line breaks, number of Mac line breaks, byte order mark, text
or binary, file name.
.Sp
Example output:

.Ve
.Sp
Note that sometimes a binary file can be mistaken for a text file. See also option \f(CW\*(C`\-s\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If in addition option \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-add\-eol\*(C'\fR is used also the type of the
line break of the last line is printed, or \f(CW\*(C`noeol\*(C'\fR if there is none.
.Sp
Example output:

.Ve
.Sp
Optionally extra flags can be set to change the output. One or more flags
can be added.
.RS 4
.IP \fB0\fR 4
.IX Item "0"
Print the file information lines followed by a null character instead of a
newline character. This enables correct interpretation of file names with
spaces or quotes when flag c is used. Use this flag in combination with
\&\fBxargs\fR\|(1) option \f(CW\-0\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-null\*(C'\fR.

.IP \fBc\fR 4
.IX Item "c"
Print only the files that would be converted.
.Sp
With the \f(CW\*(C`c\*(C'\fR flag dos2unix will print only the files that contain DOS line breaks,
unix2dos will print only file names that have Unix line breaks.
.Sp
If in addition option \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-add\-eol\*(C'\fR is used also the files that lack a
line break on the last line will be printed.

In Mac mode Unix line breaks are changed to two Mac line breaks.
.IP "\fB\-m, \-\-add\-bom\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --add-bom"
Write a Byte Order Mark (BOM) in the output file. By default an UTF\-8 BOM
is written.
.Sp
When the input file is UTF\-16, and the option \f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR is used, an UTF\-16
BOM will be written.
.Sp
Never use this option when the output encoding is other than UTF\-8, UTF\-16, or
GB18030. See also section UNICODE.
.IP "\fB\-n, \-\-newfile INFILE OUTFILE ...\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, --newfile INFILE OUTFILE ..."
New file mode. Convert file INFILE and write output to file OUTFILE.
File names must be given in pairs and wildcard names should \fInot\fR be
used or you \fIwill\fR lose your files.
.Sp
The person who starts the conversion in new file (paired) mode will be the owner
of the converted file. The read/write permissions of the new file will be the
permissions of the original file minus the \fBumask\fR\|(1) of the person who runs the
conversion.
.IP \fB\-\-no\-allow\-chown\fR 4
.IX Item "--no-allow-chown"
Don't allow file ownership change in old file mode (default).
.Sp
Abort conversion when the user and/or group ownership of the original file
can't be preserved in old file mode. See also options \f(CW\*(C`\-o\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-n\*(C'\fR. This
option is only available if dos2unix has support for preserving the user
and group ownership of files.
.IP \fB\-\-no\-add\-eol\fR 4
.IX Item "--no-add-eol"
Do not add a line break to the last line if there isn't one.
.IP "\fB\-O, \-\-to\-stdout\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O, --to-stdout"
Write to standard output, like a Unix filter. Use option \f(CW\*(C`\-o\*(C'\fR to go back to
old file (in-place) mode.
.Sp
Combined with option \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR files can be properly concatenated. No merged last
and first lines, and no Unicode byte order marks in the middle of the
concatenated file. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dos2unix \-e \-O file1.txt file2.txt > output.txt
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-o, \-\-oldfile FILE ...\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --oldfile FILE ..."
Old file mode. Convert file FILE and overwrite output to it. The program
defaults to run in this mode. Wildcard names may be used.
.Sp
In old file (in-place) mode the converted file gets the same owner, group, and
read/write permissions as the original file. Also when the file is converted by
another user who has write permissions on the file (e.g. user root).  The
conversion will be aborted when it is not possible to preserve the original
values.  Change of owner could mean that the original owner is not able to read
the file any more. Change of group could be a security risk, the file could be
made readable for persons for whom it is not intended.  Preservation of owner,
group, and read/write permissions is only supported on Unix.
.Sp
To check if dos2unix has support for preserving the user and group ownership of
files type \f(CW\*(C`dos2unix \-V\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Conversion is always done via a temporary file. When an error occurs halfway
the conversion, the temporary file is deleted and the original file stays
intact. When the conversion is successful, the original file is replaced with
the temporary file. You may have write permission on the original file, but no
permission to put the same user and/or group ownership properties on the
temporary file as the original file has. This means you are not able to
preserve the user and/or group ownership of the original file. In this case you
can use option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-allow\-chown\*(C'\fR to continue with the conversion:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dos2unix \-\-allow\-chown foo.txt
.Ve
.Sp
Another option is to use new file mode:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dos2unix \-n foo.txt foo.txt
.Ve
.Sp
The advantage of the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-allow\-chown\*(C'\fR option is that you can use wildcards,
and the ownership properties will be preserved when possible.
.IP "\fB\-q, \-\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q, --quiet"
Quiet mode. Suppress all warnings and messages. The return value is zero.
Except when wrong command-line options are used.
.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-remove\-bom\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --remove-bom"
Remove Byte Order Mark (BOM). Do not write a BOM in the output file.
This is the default behavior when converting to Unix line breaks.
See also option \f(CW\*(C`\-b\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-s, \-\-safe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --safe"
Skip binary files (default).
.Sp
The skipping of binary files is done to avoid accidental mistakes. Be aware
that the detection of binary files is not 100% foolproof. Input files are
scanned for binary symbols which are typically not found in text files. It is
possible that a binary file contains only normal text characters. Such a binary
file will mistakenly be seen as a text file.
.IP "\fB\-u, \-\-keep\-utf16\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u, --keep-utf16"
Keep the original UTF\-16 encoding of the input file. The output file will be
written in the same UTF\-16 encoding, little or big endian, as the input file.
This prevents transformation to UTF\-8. An UTF\-16 BOM will be written
accordingly. This option can be disabled with the \f(CW\*(C`\-ascii\*(C'\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-ul, \-\-assume\-utf16le\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ul, --assume-utf16le"
Assume that the input file format is UTF\-16LE.
.Sp
When there is a Byte Order Mark in the input file the BOM has priority over
this option.
.Sp
When you made a wrong assumption (the input file was not in UTF\-16LE format) and
the conversion succeeded, you will get an UTF\-8 output file with wrong text.
You can undo the wrong conversion with \fBiconv\fR\|(1) by converting the UTF\-8 output
file back to UTF\-16LE. This will bring back the original file.
.Sp
The assumption of UTF\-16LE works as a \fIconversion mode\fR. By switching to the default
\&\fIascii\fR mode the UTF\-16LE assumption is turned off.
.IP "\fB\-ub, \-\-assume\-utf16be\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ub, --assume-utf16be"
Assume that the input file format is UTF\-16BE.
.Sp
This option works the same as option \f(CW\*(C`\-ul\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose"
Display verbose messages. Extra information is displayed about Byte Order Marks
and the amount of converted line breaks.
.IP "\fB\-F, \-\-follow\-symlink\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F, --follow-symlink"
Follow symbolic links and convert the targets.
.IP "\fB\-R, \-\-replace\-symlink\fR" 4
.IX Item "-R, --replace-symlink"
Replace symbolic links with converted files
(original target files remain unchanged).
.IP "\fB\-S, \-\-skip\-symlink\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S, --skip-symlink"
Keep symbolic links and targets unchanged (default).
.IP "\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version"
Display version information and exit.
.SH "MAC MODE"
.IX Header "MAC MODE"
By default line breaks are converted from DOS to Unix and vice versa.
Mac line breaks are not converted.
.PP
In Mac mode line breaks are converted from Mac to Unix and vice versa. DOS
line breaks are not changed.
.PP
To run in Mac mode use the command-line option \f(CW\*(C`\-c mac\*(C'\fR or use the
commands \f(CW\*(C`mac2unix\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unix2mac\*(C'\fR.
.SH "CONVERSION MODES"
.IX Header "CONVERSION MODES"
.IP \fBascii\fR 4
.IX Item "ascii"
This is the default conversion mode. This mode is for converting ASCII and
ASCII-compatible encoded files, like UTF\-8. Enabling \fBascii\fR mode disables
\&\fB7bit\fR and \fBiso\fR mode.
.Sp
If dos2unix has UTF\-16 support, UTF\-16 encoded files are converted to the
current locale character encoding on POSIX systems and to UTF\-8 on Windows.
Enabling \fBascii\fR mode disables the option to keep UTF\-16 encoding (\f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR) and
the options to assume UTF\-16 input (\f(CW\*(C`\-ul\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-ub\*(C'\fR).  To see if dos2unix has
UTF\-16 support type \f(CW\*(C`dos2unix \-V\*(C'\fR. See also section UNICODE.
.IP \fB7bit\fR 4
.IX Item "7bit"
In this mode all 8 bit non-ASCII characters (with values from 128 to 255)
are converted to a 7 bit space.
.IP \fBiso\fR 4
.IX Item "iso"
Characters are converted between a DOS character set (code page) and ISO
character set ISO\-8859\-1 (Latin\-1) on Unix. DOS characters without ISO\-8859\-1
equivalent, for which conversion is not possible, are converted to a dot. The
same counts for ISO\-8859\-1 characters without DOS counterpart.
.Sp
When only option \f(CW\*(C`\-iso\*(C'\fR is used dos2unix will try to determine the active code
page. When this is not possible dos2unix will use default code page CP437,

\&\f(CW\-437\fR (US), \f(CW\-850\fR (Western European), \f(CW\-860\fR (Portuguese), \f(CW\-863\fR (French
Canadian), or \f(CW\-865\fR (Nordic).  Windows code page CP1252 (Western European) is
also supported with option \f(CW\-1252\fR. For other code pages use dos2unix in
combination with \fBiconv\fR\|(1).  Iconv can convert between a long list of character
encodings.

.SH UNICODE
.IX Header "UNICODE"
.SS Encodings
.IX Subsection "Encodings"
There exist different Unicode encodings. On Unix and Linux Unicode files are
typically encoded in UTF\-8 encoding. On Windows Unicode text files can be
encoded in UTF\-8, UTF\-16, or UTF\-16 big endian, but are mostly encoded in
UTF\-16 format.
.SS Conversion
.IX Subsection "Conversion"
Unicode text files can have DOS, Unix or Mac line breaks, like ASCII text
files.
.PP
All versions of dos2unix and unix2dos can convert UTF\-8 encoded files, because
UTF\-8 was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII.
.PP
dos2unix and unix2dos with Unicode UTF\-16 support, can read little and big
endian UTF\-16 encoded text files. To see if dos2unix was built with UTF\-16
support type \f(CW\*(C`dos2unix \-V\*(C'\fR.
.PP
On Unix/Linux UTF\-16 encoded files are converted to the locale character
encoding. Use the \fBlocale\fR\|(1) command to find out what the locale character
encoding is. When conversion is not possible a conversion error will occur and
the file will be skipped.
.PP
On Windows UTF\-16 files are by default converted to UTF\-8. UTF\-8 formatted
text files are well supported on both Windows and Unix/Linux.
.PP
UTF\-16 and UTF\-8 encoding are fully compatible, there will no text be lost in
the conversion. When an UTF\-16 to UTF\-8 conversion error occurs, for instance
when the UTF\-16 input file contains an error, the file will be skipped.
.PP
When option \f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR is used, the output file will be written in the same UTF\-16
encoding as the input file. Option \f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR prevents conversion to UTF\-8.
.PP
dos2unix and unix2dos have no option to convert UTF\-8 files to UTF\-16.
.PP
ISO and 7\-bit mode conversion do not work on UTF\-16 files.
.SS "Byte Order Mark"
.IX Subsection "Byte Order Mark"
On Windows Unicode text files typically have a Byte Order Mark (BOM), because
many Windows programs (including Notepad) add BOMs by default. See also
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark>.
.PP
On Unix Unicode files typically don't have a BOM. It is assumed that text files
are encoded in the locale character encoding.
.PP
dos2unix can only detect if a file is in UTF\-16 format if the file has a BOM.
When an UTF\-16 file doesn't have a BOM, dos2unix will see the file as a binary
file.
.PP
Use option \f(CW\*(C`\-ul\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-ub\*(C'\fR to convert an UTF\-16 file without BOM.
.PP
dos2unix writes by default no BOM in the output file. With option \f(CW\*(C`\-b\*(C'\fR
dos2unix writes a BOM when the input file has a BOM.
.PP
unix2dos writes by default a BOM in the output file when the input file has a
BOM. Use option \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR to remove the BOM.
.PP
dos2unix and unix2dos write always a BOM when option \f(CW\*(C`\-m\*(C'\fR is used.
.SS "Unicode file names on Windows"
.IX Subsection "Unicode file names on Windows"
dos2unix has optional support for reading and writing Unicode file names in the
Windows Command Prompt. That means that dos2unix can open files that have
characters in the name that are not part of the default system ANSI code page.
To see if dos2unix for Windows was built with Unicode file name support type
\&\f(CW\*(C`dos2unix \-V\*(C'\fR.
.PP
There are some issues with displaying Unicode file names in a Windows console.
See option \f(CW\*(C`\-D\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-display\-enc\*(C'\fR. The file names may be displayed wrongly in
the console, but the files will be written with the correct name.

.SH GB18030
.IX Header "GB18030"
GB18030 is a Chinese government standard. A mandatory subset of the GB18030
standard is officially required for all software products sold in China. See
also <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_18030>.
.PP
GB18030 is fully compatible with Unicode, and can be considered an unicode
transformation format. Like UTF\-8, GB18030 is compatible with ASCII. GB18030
is also compatible with Windows code page 936, also known as GBK.
.PP
On Unix/Linux UTF\-16 files are converted to GB18030 when the locale encoding is
set to GB18030. Note that this will only work if the locale is supported by the
system. Use command \f(CW\*(C`locale \-a\*(C'\fR to get the list of supported locales.
.PP
On Windows you need to use option \f(CW\*(C`\-gb\*(C'\fR to convert UTF\-16 files to GB18030.
.PP
GB18030 encoded files can have a Byte Order Mark, like Unicode files.

.SH "RECURSIVE CONVERSION"
.IX Header "RECURSIVE CONVERSION"
In a Unix shell the \fBfind\fR\|(1) and \fBxargs\fR\|(1) commands can be used to run dos2unix
recursively over all text files in a directory tree. For instance to convert
all .txt files in the directory tree under the current directory type:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    find . \-name \*(Aq*.txt\*(Aq \-print0 |xargs \-0 dos2unix
.Ve
.PP
The \fBfind\fR\|(1) option \f(CW\*(C`\-print0\*(C'\fR and corresponding \fBxargs\fR\|(1) option \f(CW\-0\fR are needed
when there are files with spaces or quotes in the name. Otherwise these options
can be omitted. Another option is to use \fBfind\fR\|(1) with the \f(CW\*(C`\-exec\*(C'\fR option:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    find . \-name \*(Aq*.txt\*(Aq \-exec dos2unix {} \e;

.PP
In a Windows Command Prompt the following command can be used:
.PP
.Vb 1

.SH LOCALIZATION
.IX Header "LOCALIZATION"
.IP \fBLANG\fR 4
.IX Item "LANG"
The primary language is selected with the environment variable LANG. The LANG
variable consists out of several parts. The first part is in small letters the
language code. The second is optional and is the country code in capital
letters, preceded with an underscore. There is also an optional third part:
character encoding, preceded with a dot. A few examples for POSIX standard type
shells:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    export LANG=nl               Dutch
\&    export LANG=nl_NL            Dutch, The Netherlands
\&    export LANG=nl_BE            Dutch, Belgium
\&    export LANG=es_ES            Spanish, Spain
\&    export LANG=es_MX            Spanish, Mexico
\&    export LANG=en_US.iso88591   English, USA, Latin\-1 encoding

.Ve
.Sp
For a complete list of language and country codes see the gettext manual:
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Usual\-Language\-Codes.html>
.Sp
On Unix systems you can use the command \fBlocale\fR\|(1) to get locale specific
information.
.IP \fBLANGUAGE\fR 4
.IX Item "LANGUAGE"
With the LANGUAGE environment variable you can specify a priority list of
languages, separated by colons. dos2unix gives preference to LANGUAGE over LANG.
For instance, first Dutch and then German: \f(CW\*(C`LANGUAGE=nl:de\*(C'\fR. You have to first
enable localization, by setting LANG (or LC_ALL) to a value other than
"C", before you can use a language priority list through the LANGUAGE
variable. See also the gettext manual:
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/The\-LANGUAGE\-variable.html>
.Sp
If you select a language which is not available you will get the
standard English messages.
.IP \fBDOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR\fR 4
.IX Item "DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR"
With the environment variable DOS2UNIX_LOCALEDIR the LOCALEDIR set
during compilation can be overruled. LOCALEDIR is used to find the
language files. The GNU default value is \f(CW\*(C`/usr/local/share/locale\*(C'\fR.
Option \fB\-\-version\fR will display the LOCALEDIR that is used.
